# Improvements

- The CI deployment pipelines generated by `genesis` now support waiting on BOSH to finish
  its active tasks before starting a deployment. This is highly useful for pipelines that
  deploy BOSH itself, so you do not interrupt active tasks by upgrading BOSH.

  To configure it, set the `meta.pause_for_existing_bosh_tasks` value to `true` in
  `ci/settings.yml`. If not set, this defaults to `false`.

  The deployment task will wait up to 100 seconds for BOSH to finish current tasks.
  If tasks are stull running after 100 seconds, it will give up, refusing to deploy.
