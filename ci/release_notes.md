# Improvements

- The CI deployment pipelines generated by `genesis` now support waiting on BOSH to finish
  its active tasks before starting a deployment. This is highly useful for pipelines that
  deploy BOSH itself, so you do not interrupt active tasks by upgrading BOSH.

  To configure it, set the `meta.pause_for_existing_bosh_tasks` value to `true` in
  `ci/settings.yml`. If not set, this defaults to `false`. Additionally, to help guide
  genesis to target the right BOSH to query for active tasks, you will need to add additional
  aliases in your `ci/boshes.yml`, pointing the name of the BOSH director (from it's name.yml
  file) to the URL of the director:

        aliases:
          target:
            f635b1ba-5000-48e1-92c8-19471d20e0e4: https://10.10.10.10:25555
            vsphere-prod-bosh: https://10.10.10.10:25555

  The deployment task will wait up to 100 seconds for BOSH to finish current tasks.
  If tasks are stull running after 100 seconds, it will give up, refusing to deploy.
